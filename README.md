# NagarroTest
Parser of Strings

Dependencies: 

- JUnit 5.4

Description:

In the programming language of your choice, write a program that parses a sentence and replaces each word with the following: first letter, number of distinct characters between first and last character, and last letter.  For example, Smooth would become S3h.  Words are separated by spaces or non-alphabetic characters and these separators should be maintained in their original form and location in the answer.

Execution:

The program requests the sentence which will be split in a list of words, this list will be processed by the 
parser function and finally the result will be printed.

Example:

- Input: Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
- Output: L3m I3m i0s s4y d2y t2t o0f t1e p4g a1d t7g i6y.
